### Using ChatGPT Desktop App

The _unofficial_ ChatGPT desktop application provides a convenient way to access and use the prompts in this repository. With the app, you can easily import all the prompts and use them with slash commands, such as `/linux_terminal`. This feature eliminates the need to manually copy and paste prompts each time you want to use them.

> **Desktop App is an unofficial [open source project by @lencx](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT). It's a simple wrapper for ChatGPT web interface with powerful extras.**
