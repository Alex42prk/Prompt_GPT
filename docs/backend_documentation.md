# Notes for the Developers

The files in `src` are used to generate the `README.md` based on the files in `docs`.





To update the readme page with the latest changes, use the terminal to run the following command:

```bash
!python ./src/generate_topic_files.py
!python ./src/generate_readme.py
```
